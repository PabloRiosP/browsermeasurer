# Simple Web Browser Measurer
A super simple web browser inner dimensions measurer. For now just inner window dimensions. It dinamically changes on window resizing.

Just a quick tool that I made in a while for making browser measurements for my portfolio's prototyping. It's not pretty, but functional enough.

I uploaded this with hope it helps somebody.

It uses Javascript, so make sure wour browser allows JS before running this.

Tested in Mozilla Firefox, but it should run in most GUI web browsers with JS functionality.

Feedback is appreciated. Feel free to propose improvements if you want.
